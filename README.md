# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) provides programming puzzles each year in form of an Advent calendar.

This repository contains my solutions to these problems written in C++. While I strive to use as few external libraries as possible, for now I am using [cryptopp](https://cryptopp.com/) where the tasks require the calculation of MD5 hashes. In the future I hope to replace this with my own MD5-algorithm.
